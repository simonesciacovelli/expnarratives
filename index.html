Ned Land is a master harpooner. He was most likely brought in due to Dr. Aronnax's theory that the creature was a great narhwal. The opposite of Dr. Aronnax, Land is the first to follow his gut and takes reality as what he sees to be the truth, instead of believing what others inform him.</p>

It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke.
At these words, <span class="pop1" href="">Ned Land</span> rose suddenly. The steward, nearly strangled,
tottered out on a sign from his master. But such was the power of the
commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which
this man must have felt towards the Canadian. Conseil interested in
spite of himself, I stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this
scene. <br><br>
The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with his arms
folded, scanned us with profound attention. Did he hesitate to speak?
Did he regret the words which he had just spoken in French? One might
almost think so.<br><br>
After some moments of silence, which not one of us dreamed of breaking,
"Gentlemen," said he, in a calm and penetrating voice, "I speak French,
English, German, and Latin equally well. I could, therefore, have
answered you at our first interview, but I wished to know you first,
then to reflect. The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the
main points, convinced me of your identity. I know now that chance has
brought before me M. Pierre Aronnax, Professor of Natural History at
the Museum of Paris, entrusted with a scientific mission abroad,

Conseil, his servant, and Ned Land, of Canadian origin, harpooner on
board the <span class="pop2">frigate</span> Abraham Lincoln of the navy of the United States of
America." <br><br>
I bowed assent. It was not a question that the commander put to me.
Therefore there was no answer to be made. This man expressed himself
with perfect ease, without any accent. His sentences were well turned,
his words clear, and his fluency of speech remarkable. Yet, I did not
recognise in him a fellow-countryman.<br><br>
He continued the conversation in these terms:
"You have doubtless thought, sir, that I have delayed long in paying
you this second visit. The reason is that, your identity recognised, I
wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you. I have
hesitated much. Most annoying circumstances have brought you into the
presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity. You have
come to trouble my existence."<br><br>
"Unintentionally!" said I.<br><br>

struck me with his harpoon?" <br><br>
I detected a restrained irritation in these words. But to these
recriminations I had a very natural answer to make, and I made it.
"Sir," said I, "no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have
taken place concerning you in America and Europe. You do not know that
divers accidents, caused by collisions with your submarine machine,
have excited public feeling in the two continents. I omit the theories
without number by which it was sought to explain that of which you
alone possess the secret. But you must understand that, in pursuing
you over the high seas of the Pacific, the Abraham Lincoln believed
itself to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which it was
necessary to rid the ocean at any price."<br><br>
A half-smile curled the lips of the commander: then, in a calmer tone:
"M. Aronnax," he replied, "dare you affirm that your frigate would not
as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?"
This question embarrassed me, for certainly Captain Farragut might not
have hesitated. He might have thought it his duty to destroy a
contrivance of this kind, as he would a gigantic narwhal.
"You understand then, sir," continued the stranger, "that I have the
right to treat you as enemies?"

You are going to visit the land of marvels. <br><br>
These words of the commander had a great effect upon me. I cannot deny
it. My weak point was touched; and I forgot, for a moment, that the
contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of
liberty. Besides, I trusted to the future to decide this grave
question. So I contented myself with saying:
"By what name ought I to address you?"<br><br>
"Sir," replied the commander, "I am nothing to you but Captain Nemo;
and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the
Nautilus."<br><br>
Captain Nemo called. A steward appeared. The captain gave him his
orders in that strange language which I did not understand. Then,
turning towards the Canadian and Conseil:
"A repast awaits you in your cabin," said he. "Be so good as to follow
this man.<br><br>
"And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready. Permit me to lead the
way."<br><br>
"I am at your service, Captain."
